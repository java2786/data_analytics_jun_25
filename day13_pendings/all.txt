1. Data Export and Import
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';
-- /var/lib/mysql-files

SELECT * FROM tutorial.Items
INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/product.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';


LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/product.csv'
INTO TABLE Items
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 0 ROWS;  




2. Backup and Recovery
mysqldump -u root -proot tutorial > abc.sql

mysql -u root -proot tutorial < abc.sql 


c:/program files/sql server/8.0/bin
mysql.exe -> command

mysql -u root -proot

mysqldump.exe 

=======

mysqldump -uroot -proot123 tutorial > full_backup.sql
mysql -uroot -proot123 tutorial < full_backup.sql



3. Security and User Management

User Roles and Permissions

Example: 
    -- Grant SELECT access to ramesh for tutorial
    CREATE USER 'ramesh'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ramesh@123';
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON tutorial.* TO 'ramesh'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Revoke Access
    REVOKE SELECT ON tutorial.* FROM 'ramesh'@'%';
    DROP USER 'ramesh'@'%';




4. MySQL Tools and Interfaces

MySQL Tools and Interfaces
    MySQL Workbench:
        Connect to localhost:3306
        Use Query tab to write SQL
        Visualize data from tables
    DBeaver or DataGrip:
        Lightweight GUI alternatives
        Easy for schema and ER modeling
    Command Line Clients:
        mysql CLI inside Docker container
        mysqldump, mysqladmin for DBA operations



5. Basic Data Analysis Techniques
Sample Table: student_scores
-- Highest Marks
SELECT * FROM student_scores ORDER BY marks DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Average Marks
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student_scores;

-- Count students with marks > 80
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_scores WHERE marks > 80;

-- Group by Score Ranges
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN marks >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN marks >= 75 THEN 'Good'
    ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
  END AS category,
  COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM student_scores
GROUP BY category;











Assignments
Assignment 1: Import and Analyze Employee CSV
Create table employees (id, name, salary)
Import from CSV using Docker volume
Write queries to find: - Highest salary - Count of employees above â‚¹50,000 - Average salary
Assignment 2: Secure Access for Meeta (User Access)
Create user meeta with password meeta@123
Grant only SELECT and INSERT permissions on employees
Revoke INSERT after use
Assignment 3: Backup Strategy
Take full backup using mysqldump
Drop the student_scores table
Restore from backup and verify
